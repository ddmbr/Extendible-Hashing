format of index page:
---------------------
an sequence of (hvalue, bucket_id) tuples
each integer use 32bit = 4byte
each tuple use 8byte

format of bucket page:
----------------------
divide into two part, the first part, `fxdata`, starts from the front,
the other part, `vadata`, starts from the end. The unused free space
in the middle is called free part.

* `fxdata`
    This part is used to store fixed-size data. For strings, we represent it by two
    integer, (start, length). The `start` is the position of the string in the `vadata`
    part.

* `vadata`
    This part is to store strings. For example, if three strings were inserted in order.
        'hello', 'monkey', 'sah'
    Then in this part, they are stored like:
        sahmonkeyhello(end of the page)
